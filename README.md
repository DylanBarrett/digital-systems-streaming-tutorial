## Platforms
  * ### [Twitch](https://twitch.tv/)
    The hands down most popular streaming platform on the internet right now is currently Twitch.tv. This website exploded in growth back when it was known as Justin.tv. In early 2014 the website changed it's name to what it is today. Overall the website is about gaming related streaming, but recently has expanded it's horizons to include IRL, Music, Talkshows, etc...

    Twitch has a very active community and a plethora of developers actively making plugins, chatbots, and services to help aid in your streaming adventures. Not to mention Twitch itself is constantly striving to improve, with features like VOD saving/upload, a desktop app, a good notification system (looking at you youtube), and a great dashboard for everything you need to edit your stream/profile.

    I'll be using Twitch.tv for the basis of showing how to setup our software later on and getting ourselves live on the web.
  
  * ### [Youtube Gaming](https://gaming.youtube.com/)
    As opposed to just uploading videos, Youtube started allowing users with over 1000 subscribers in May of 2013. Throughout the year it slowly reduced this limit. In 2017 Youtube also allowed users to stream using it's mobile app. Twitch definitely is more popular, at least with gamers, but youtube is also more lax with it's TOS which can be a big draw to many users in the current Twitch atmosphere. Plus who doesn't know about youtube in this day and age?

    I won't be using Youtube for my examples later on, but it is actually quite simple to setup. See this [link](https://support.google.com/youtubegaming/answer/6305973?hl=en) if this seems interesting to you. It's an official guide by Google on how to get up and running with their streaming service.

  * ### [Mixer](https://mixer.com/)
    In 2016 Microsoft decided to join the excitement and created their own streaming platform. Microsoft bought out the formerly known service Beam to compete with other popular streaming services. One nice reason to use Mixer is that it is intergrated into the Xbox One dashboard. Mixer focused primarily on gaming like many of it's competitors, but one shining feature is that unlike other chat interactions; mixer allows for users to press actual buttons on the side of the stream to interact with games. So instead of sending very particular messages in a chat for a bot to read, you can quite simply press buttons to interact + chat normally to talk with the streamer.

  These three services are the top dops right now. There are obviously others but none of them pull in anywhere close to the consisten number that streamers on the above services can achieve.

## Software
  * ### [OBS](https://obsproject.com/)
    OBS or "Open Broadcast Software" is one of the more popular streaming softwares available, especially on Twitch. This is the software I will be using in my example later on. OBS allows for countless scenes, keybinding for everything, easy to make re-usable sources, along with a plethora of settings. OBS also allows for plugins and other 3rd party services to create add-ons for their software (see [StreamsLabs](#streamlabs) below in tools). Along with streaming, you can also record. You can do this at the same time or completely seperately. Personally I use OBS for recording as well since all your scenes can be used for either.

    As a note of warning OBS can be pretty resource intensive if you are not careful. Since it has so many options, it can take a lot of fine tuning/optimizations to create a good stream experience for your viewers while keeping your computer from seeing blue. Some of the below examples are more lightweight and are better for rigs that can't handle OBS + an activity (also see [Special Setups](#special-setups) below as well).

  * ### [XSplit](https://www.xsplit.com/)
    XSplit is a great alternative to OBS. It has been around for a very long time as a resource for gamers, originally used just for recording. Currently with XSplit you have two options: Broadcaster or Gamecaster.

    Broadcaster is the more verbose of the two services XSplit provides. It is meant for those looking for a more professional & advanced setup that allows for a great amount of customizability. Broadcaster can be used for either streaming or recording.

    Gamecaster allows for easy setup and go streaming for gamers. It has easy access to many stream controls, plugins, and social media. It may be less customizable compared to Broadcaster, but it's widget system allows for adding everything you might need to get your stream up and running quickly.

    XSplit as compared to OBS or Bebo isn't free though. If you want to use it commercially you will have pay at most $8.32 a month (based on current pricing of a 3 month license). You can use it for free of course, but the capabilities are hindered.

  * ### [Bebo](https://bebo.com/)
    Bebo is a new streaming app that is trying to making streaming easier and less messy compared to its competitors. Bebo combines all the best plugins, extensions, and services right into its app. This makes it a one stop shop for getting up and running with your stream. You can make use of scenes, chat, stats, alerts, and your video feed all on one screen. Plus it's layout is completely customizable. Bebo's integration with a lot of your favorite apps makes it a great new comer into the realm of streaming software and is definitely one I am going to keep my eye on.

## Tools
  * ### [StreamLabs](https://streamlabs.com/)
    StreamLabs is one of the most popular stream tools available currently (slightly better or tied with [StreamElements](#streamelements)). It is used by a lot of the top streamers on Twitch. This will be the tool I will be implementing in my [Full Start Guide](#full-start-guide). 
    
    StreamLabs allows for easy to use alerts, stats, and chat bots. StreamLabs also has a full desktop app that is integrated ontop of OBS allowing for the ultimate streaming experience. This desktop app comes with 1000s of free themes and can help you get up and running quick.
    
    StreamLabs integration with OBS allows for better game specific video encoding and less CPU usage on average. Along with this the desktop app allows for a single live view of everything going on with your app: Video feed, chat, stats, alerts, and OBS settings. 

    Unfortunately the desktop app is only available for Windows, while OBS in general is available for Mac and Linux as well. You can also use the website version, but it obviously won't be integrated into OBS for you. The website version is still fantastic and provides a similar live dashboard with alerts and settings.

  * ### [StreamElements](https://streamelements.com/)
    StreamElements is very similar in terms of functionality provided to its users compared to StreamLabs. Both of the services are extremely good and its purely up to your discretion which one you pick up and stick with. 

    StreamElements comes with a handy customizable chatbot. It has a cool module system that allows for drag and drop functionality for making your chatbot better in all sorts of ways. It also has a vast library of themes to get your stream up and running, while looking good in the process. It also has a custom overlay system that boats "unrivaled management of your overlays". It allows for saving of setups to your account so you can stream anywhere and everywhere you have an internet connection. 

  * ### [Muxy](https://muxy.io/)
    Muxy is more unique in that it isn't as large as the two services mentioned above but it does very well in its niche userbase. It has great custom alerts, cheer cups, and plenty of extensions to help you and your stream. It has great integration with Esports and Brand analytics; great for teams or event organizers. 

    Muxy also has an extensive development kit that allows for a lot of customizability in creating twitch extensions. They have a lot of templates you can use, allow for the creation of your own, or you can even hire them out for special requests.
