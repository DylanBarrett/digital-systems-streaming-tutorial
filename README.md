## Platforms
  * ### Twitch
    The hands down most popular streaming platform on the internet right now is currently Twitch.tv. This website exploded in growth back when it was known as Justin.tv. In early 2014 the website changed it's name to what it is today. Overall the website is about gaming related streaming, but recently has expanded it's horizons to include IRL, Music, Talkshows, etc...

    Twitch has a very active community and a plethora of developers actively making plugins, chatbots, and services to help aid in your streaming adventures. Not to mention Twitch itself is constantly striving to improve, with features like VOD saving/upload, a desktop app, a good notification system (looking at you youtube), and a great dashboard for everything you need to edit your stream/profile.

    I'll be using Twitch.tv for the basis of showing how to setup our software later on and getting ourselves live on the web.
  
  * ### Youtube Gaming
    As opposed to just uploading videos, Youtube started allowing users with over 1000 subscribers in May of 2013. Throughout the year it slowly reduced this limit. In 2017 Youtube also allowed users to stream using it's mobile app. Twitch definitely is more popular, at least with gamers, but youtube is also more lax with it's TOS which can be a big draw to many users in the current Twitch atmosphere. Plus who doesn't know about youtube in this day and age?

    I won't be using Youtube for my examples later on, but it is actually quite simple to setup. See this [link](https://support.google.com/youtubegaming/answer/6305973?hl=en) if this seems interesting to you. It's an official guide by Google on how to get up and running with their streaming service.

  * ### Mixer
    In 2016 Microsoft decided to join the excitement and created their own streaming platform. Microsoft bought out the formerly known service Beam to compete with other popular streaming services. One nice reason to use Mixer is that it is intergrated into the Xbox One dashboard. Mixer focused primarily on gaming like many of it's competitors, but one shining feature is that unlike other chat interactions; mixer allows for users to press actual buttons on the side of the stream to interact with games. So instead of sending very particular messages in a chat for a bot to read, you can quite simply press buttons to interact + chat normally to talk with the streamer.

  These three services are the top dops right now. There are obviously others but none of them pull in anywhere close to the consisten number that streamers on the above services can achieve.
